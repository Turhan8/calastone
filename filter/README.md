#Assumptions

- no quotation marks are printed. The text reads as the quotation marks war wanted but it would have made the solution unneceassarily complex. And without the context the quotation marks makes no sense.

#Notes

- Introduces readonly variables for delimiters, punctuation marks and wovels. It maybe a better idea to use repository pattersn for such static data and keep the values in the DB. This will enable runtime changes when needed.
